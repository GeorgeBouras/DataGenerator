Columns Definition file documentation

Its syntax is very simple, ini like.
Lines starting from # are comments
You can have multiple columns with the same name if you want.

All columns properties are optional with reasonable defaults
The available column types are and their corresponded properties are


TELEPHONE INTERNATIONAL	
                   phone number with international and country suffixes
TELEPHONE LOCAL    phone number with country suffixes
MASK               text generated from the FORMAT e.g.   foo[a-t]_[0-3][1-9]_[A-D]
CONSTANT           A fixed string e.g.   hello world
AUTO INCREMENT     Auto increment integer
DATE               format date using the:  <DD> <MM> <YYYY> <hh> <mm> <ss> <MONTHNAME> <DAYNAME> <D> <M> <YY> <h> <m> <s>
DATE RANDOM        A random date between "DATE MINIMUM" and "DATE MAXIMUM" using the same format as DATE
UUID               Universally unique identifier  ( 39ef343e-78eb-418b-a618-36d896e974f6 )
NUMBER             A random integer from LENGTH MINIMUM to LENGTH MAXIMUM
TEXT               A random text    from LENGTH MINIMUM to LENGTH MAXIMUM with  characters from PERMITTED CHARACTERS
RANDOM             A random string  from LENGTH MINIMUM to LENGTH MAXIMUM from  PERMITTED CHARACTERS
EMAIL              a random email address that looks believable
FIRST NAME MALE    English common   male first name
FIRST NAME FEMALE  English common female first name
FIRST NAME         English common first name
SURNAME            English common surname
IP ADDRESS         IP Address v4
HOSTNAME           computername that looks real
COUNTRY            Greece, New Zeland, etc
STREET             Street name

PERL CODE          Run arbitary perl code on any existing <column>
                   "PERL CODE" columns can be defined even before the columns they are using
                   FORMAT contains your code e.g.   'Lest add ' . ( <col1> + <col2> )

FROM FILES         This the most important because you can define your own samples.
                   It is very flexible because you can have for each column multiple files with
                   separate lookup possibilities
                   

Columns properties
------------------

FORMAT when it used at CONSTAND    is a fixed string e.g.   hello world
FORMAT when it used at MASK        is a template     e.g.   foo_[a-t].[1-3].[A-Z]-[5-9]
FORMAT when it used at PERL CODE   is a template     e.g    "foo <col1>@<col2>_<col3>"
FORMAT when it used at DATE, DATE RANDOM contains any of the special variables

	<DAYNAME>    Name of day   Sun, Mon, ...
	<MONTHNAME>  Name of month Jan, Feb, ...
	<DD>         Day           01 - 31
	<MM>         Month         01 - 12
	<YYYY>       Year          four digits
	<YY>         Year          two  digits
	<hh>         Hour          00 - 23
	<mm>         Minute        00 - 59
	<ss>         Second        00 - 59
	<D>          Day            1 - 31
	<M>          Month          1 - 12
	<h>          Hour           0 - 23
	<m>          Minute         0 - 59
	<s>          Second         0 - 59


HIDDEN                          If No, the field is not displayed.
                                Usefull when you want to use fields as members of PERL CODE but not shown at the output
DATE MINIMUM					Specify the minimum DATE like  07 Feb 1982, 00:30:00
DATE MAXIMUM					Specify the maximum DATE like  17 Apr 1991, 23:30:00
LENGTH MINIMUM					Minimum length of NUMBER, TEXT, RANDOM
LENGTH MAXIMUM					Maximum length of NUMBER, TEXT, RANDOM
PERMITTED CHARACTERS			Choose only from these characters
AUTO INCREMENT START NUMBER		integer    , start counting the "AUTO INCREMENT" from this nuber
                                EPOCH      , start counting the "AUTO INCREMENT" from seconds from 1971
AUTO INCREMENT RESET NUMBER		Reset "AUTO INCREMENT" to "AUTO INCREMENT START NUMBER" if it is equal or greater the specified number
AUTO INCREMENT PREFIX			a string before the "AUTO INCREMENT" e.g. id_
AUTO INCREMENT PADDED WITH 0	Adds as many 0 as PREFIX until the length of
                                "AUTO INCREMENT RESET NUMBER".  If you set something as
                                "AUTO INCREMENT PREFIX" then it is disabled


For  FILE  all its possibilities for all the FILE statements must sum to 100.

	FILE = FILEPATH: c:\data\important.txt  , POSSIBILITY: 80%
	FILE = FILEPATH: c:\data\less often.txt , POSSIBILITY: 19%
	FILE = FILEPATH: c:\data\obsolete.txt   , POSSIBILITY: 1%

Files must have their data as simple lines, for example

	line1
	line2
	...
